        <h1 class="h1">Adem Jashari</h1>
        <p class="p1"> Adem Jashari (born Fazli Jashari; 28 November 1955 – 7 March 1998) was one
            of the founders of the
            Kosovo
            Liberation Army (KLA), a Kosovo Albanian separatist militia which fought for the secession of Kosovo from
            the
            Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the 1990s.[3][4][5][6][7]

            Beginning in 1991, Jashari participated in attacks against the Serbian police before travelling to Albania
            to
            receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released at the behest of the Albanian Army and later
            returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997,
            he
            was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture
            or
            kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that
            followed resulted in the deaths of 57 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife,
            brother
            and son.</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Biography</h2>
        <p class="p">Adem Shaban Jashari[8] was born in the village of Prekaz, SAP Kosovo, SFR Yugoslavia on 28 November
            1955[9]
            as
            Fazli Jashari.[1] Descended from Kosovo Albanian guerrillas who had fought Yugoslav forces decades
            prior,[10] he
            was raised on Albanian war stories and was rarely seen without a gun.[9] According to the journalist Tim
            Judah,
            Jashari "hated the Serbs, and although he was one of the KLA’s early recruits, he was no ideological
            guerrilla."

        <h3 class="h3">Legacy</h3>
        <p class="p">The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members,
            some in
            government, and by Kosovar Albanian society resulting in songs, literature, monuments, memorials with
            streets
            and buildings bearing his name across Kosovo.[36][37] Dubbed the "Legendary Commander" (Albanian: Komandanti
            Legjendar) by Albanians,[38] Jashari is regarded by many in Kosovo as being the "father of the KLA".
            Portraits
            of him carrying an automatic weapon often adorn the walls of homes inhabited by ethnic Albanians.[39]
            Considered
            a symbol of independence by Kosovo Albanians, the anniversary of Jashari's death is annually commemorated in
            Kosovo[21] and his home has since been transformed into a shrine.</p>
