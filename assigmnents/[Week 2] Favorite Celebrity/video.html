                <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,[12] is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.[13] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.

                    In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it. It increased its use among those learning to code versus those developing as a profession (78% vs. 74%)</p>
