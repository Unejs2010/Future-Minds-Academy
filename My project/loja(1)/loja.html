        <h1 class="font">SOME THINGS ABOUT "ADEM JASHARI"</h1>
        <p class="padding">Adem Jashari (born Fazli Jashari; 28 November 1955 – 7 March 1998) was one of the founders of the Kosovo
            Liberation Army (KLA), a Kosovo Albanian separatist militia which fought for the secession of Kosovo from
            the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the 1990s.

            Beginning in 1991, Jashari participated in attacks against the Serbian police before travelling to Albania
            to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released at the behest of the Albanian Army and later
            returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997,
            he was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court; the trial was subsequently criticized by
            Human Rights Watch.</p>

        <h1 class="font">ADEM JASHARI'S BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p class="padding">Early life
            Adem Shaban Jashari[8] was born in the village of Prekaz, SAP Kosovo, SFR Yugoslavia on 28 November 1955[9]
            as Fazli Jashari.[1] Descended from Kosovo Albanian guerrillas who had fought Yugoslav forces decades
            prior,[10] he was raised on Albanian war stories and was rarely seen without a gun.[9] According to the
            journalist Tim Judah, Jashari "hated the Serbs, and although he was one of the KLA’s early recruits, he was
            no ideological guerrilla."

            Guerrilla activities
            See also: Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)
            Drenica is a hilly region in central Kosovo inhabited almost exclusively by Kosovo Albanians. Prior to the
            Kosovo War, the government of Yugoslavia considered it "the hotbed of Albanian terrorism."[12] Jashari was a
            farmer.[13] In 1991, he participated in an armed uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo.[14]
            During this period, a Kosovo Albanian irredentist organization that came to be known as the Kosovo
            Liberation Army first emerged.[13]</p>

        <h1 class="font">ADEM JASHARI'S LEGACY</h1>
        <p class="padding">The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members, some in
            government, and by Kosovar Albanian society resulting in songs, literature, monuments, memorials with
            streets and buildings bearing his name across Kosovo.[36][37] Dubbed the "Legendary Commander" (Albanian:
            Komandanti Legjendar) by Albanians,[38] Jashari is regarded by many in Kosovo as being the "father of the
            KLA". Portraits of him carrying an automatic weapon often adorn the walls of homes inhabited by ethnic
            Albanians.[39] Considered a symbol of independence by Kosovo Albanians, the anniversary of Jashari's death
            is annually commemorated in Kosovo[21] and his home has since been transformed into a shrine. The field
            where he and his family were buried has since become a place of pilgrimage for Kosovo Albanians, and several
            authors have equated Jashari with Albanian national hero Skanderbeg[40] as well as Albanian kaçak rebels
            from the past.[20] Following Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, Jashari was posthumously awarded
            the title "Hero of Kosovo" for his role in the Kosovo War.[21] The football stadium in Mitrovica,[41] the
            National Theatre in Pristina[38] and Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari have also been named after
            him.</p>
